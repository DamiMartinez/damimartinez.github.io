Hey! I'm **Damian Martinez Carmona**, a tech entrepreneur and engineer with years of experience building online products and data platforms.

I love creating things that solve real problems, especially when it involves wrangling data or automating boring tasks. These days, I’m exploring artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on the intersection of **AI and Data Engineering**, and how AI can enhance data processing and analysis.

I'm always up for interesting conversations about AI, data, or whatever you're building.
