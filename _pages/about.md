Hey! I'm **Damian**, a tech entrepreneur and engineer with years of experience building online products and data platforms.

I love creating things that solve real problems, especially when it involves wrangling data or automating boring tasks. These days I'm exploring **AI agents** and how they can make our digital lives easier. **Web scraping** is my guilty pleasure hobby – there's something satisfying about extracting useful data from the chaos of the internet.

Always up for interesting conversations about AI, data, or whatever you're building.
