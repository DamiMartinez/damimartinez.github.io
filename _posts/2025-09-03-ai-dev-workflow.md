title: My New Development Workflow I Don't Write Code Anymore
categories: [AI, Productivity, Coding]
---

Over the past few months, my workflow as a developer has changed completely.  
I don’t really “write code” anymore — instead, I define tasks, let AI coding agents handle the implementation, and focus on reviewing and improving the results.  

Here’s how I’ve set it up.  


## The Core Engine: `AGENTS.md`

At the center of everything is a simple file: **`AGENTS.md`**.  

It’s the playbook for any AI assistant working on my projects. It describes the rules, project structure, coding standards, and overall workflow.  

Before starting a task, the agent reads it and follows it. This way, no matter which coding assistant I’m using, everything stays consistent.  


## Templates for Every Task

Alongside `AGENTS.md`, I keep a folder called `@ai_docs/templates/`.  

Whenever I need a feature, bug fix, or review, I start from a template. The coding agent fills it in, creating a detailed task document that goes into `@ai_docs/tasks/`.  

This makes sure that tasks are always clearly defined before touching any code.  

The best part is that templates **improve over time**. Whenever the AI makes a mistake, I loop back and update the template so it won’t happen again. The more I use the system, the more accurate it becomes.  


## My Role: From Coder to Reviewer

Instead of writing code line by line, my role now looks like this:  

1. Define a task using a template.  
2. Let the agent generate the task doc and code.  
3. Review, correct, and update the template if needed.  

I use **Cursor** and the **Gemini CLI** for the actual implementation and reviews, but the process is always the same.  

This shift has freed me up to focus on **architecture, design, and quality assurance** instead of syntax and boilerplate.  


## Parallel Tasks = More Productivity

Another big change: I’m no longer stuck doing one thing at a time.  

- While one agent is preparing a task doc, I can define another.  
- While code is being generated for one feature, I can review another.  
- Everything runs in parallel, and I just keep moving between tasks.  

That alone makes me multiple times more productive.  


## Double-Check Review

To make sure the quality is there, I always do a **double-check**:  

1. One agent (like Cursor) writes the solution.  
2. I review it.  
3. A second agent (like Gemini) reviews the same code.  

That second pass usually adds small but important improvements and makes the final result more solid.  


## Agent-Agnostic by Design

Since the rules live in `AGENTS.md` and tasks are based on templates, the workflow doesn’t depend on a specific tool.  

Anyone can clone the repo, use their preferred coding assistant, and get the same consistent process.

## Where This Came From

I actually got this idea from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO9ly_ZDiUE).  

Most of what I do (about 85%) comes from that video’s template + task system. The only extra thing I added is the **`AGENTS.md` layer**, which makes the whole setup more standardized and easier to scale.  


## Conclusion

Shifting from coder to orchestrator has made me:  
- more **productive** (parallel tasks)  
- more **accurate** (templates improve over time)  
- more **consistent** (agent-agnostic setup)  
- and more **reliable** (double-check reviews)  

If you’d like me to share **sample templates, AGENTS.md, or task files**, just send me a DM on LinkedIn or email me (address is on my website).  
I might even publish some examples in a future post.
