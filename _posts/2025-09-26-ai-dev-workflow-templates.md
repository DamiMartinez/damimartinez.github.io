title: Open Sourcing My AI Development Workflow Templates
categories: [AI, Productivity, Open Source]
---

This time, I’m excited to share something practical: an open source repo with the **templates and playbooks I use to drive my AI-coding workflows**:  
👉 [github.com/DamiMartinez/ai-dev-workflow-templates](https://github.com/DamiMartinez/ai-dev-workflow-templates)

This is the third article in my AI workflow series (after  
[My New Development Workflow](https://damimartinez.github.io/ai-dev-workflow/)  
and  
[Adding References & Context Sources](https://damimartinez.github.io/ai-dev-workflow-part2/)).  


## Why this repo?

When you work with AI coding agents (Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.), a lot of the success comes from giving them **structured instructions**. Over time, I built a set of reusable templates and a base `AGENTS.md` file that make my workflow faster, more consistent, and easier to scale.  

Instead of keeping these private, I wanted to open them up so that:  

- Developers don’t need to reinvent templates from scratch  
- The community can collaborate and contribute new ones  
- We all get a stronger starting point for AI-assisted development  


## What’s inside

The repo is designed as a **community-driven collection** of templates and task definitions for common dev scenarios.  

Currently it includes:  

- **`001_task_planning_template.md`** → a systematic framework for planning and executing projects with AI assistance  
- **`002_bug_fix_template.md`** → a structured approach to analyzing and resolving bugs  
- **`003_code_review_template.md`** → a comprehensive template for running consistent code reviews  
- **`004_git_commit_workflow.md`** → a workflow for writing clear and conventional git commits  
- A base **`AGENTS.md`** file to standardize how assistants approach tasks  

The idea is that whenever you spin up a coding agent, it can read `AGENTS.md`, pick the right template, and immediately follow a clear process.


## How to use it

1. Clone the repo  
2. Integrate the `AGENTS.md` and templates into your coding tool setup  
3. Use them as starting points for features, bug fixes, reviews, or commits  
4. Contribute back with your own templates so the community grows  


## Conclusion

This repo turns the ideas from my previous posts into something **you can plug into your own workflow today**.  

If you’d like to collaborate, check out the repo, try the templates, and submit your own contributions. Together, we can build a **shared library of AI-workflow templates** that saves everyone time and effort.
